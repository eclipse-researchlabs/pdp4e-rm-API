Interception can only be performed once the presence of the communication signal is detected. However, communication signals are typically not intended for reception by third parties and security mechanisms are often employed to protect communication transmissions from compromise. Sophisticated techniques are therefore required to reliably detect the presence of, and to extract information from, the communication signal of interest.\nLow Probability of Detection (LPD) communications are two approaches which can be used to enhance transmission security, which refers to securing radio frequency (RF) or wireless transmissions against jamming signals [1]. Jamming involves the injection of noise waveforms, interfering signals or signals masquerading as communication signals (control or information e.g. false messages) into the target receiver.\n[1] D.
