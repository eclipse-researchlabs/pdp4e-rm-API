Lawfulness is deemed respected if the data subject has consented to the processing for specific purposes, if such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for compliance with a legal obligation, to protect the vital interests of the subject or of another natural person, or “for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data” and particularly when the data subject is a child."

The data subject might not be even aware at all that such personal data have been collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and what is the extent of this processing (Recital 39 GDPR). Consequently, there will be no information provided relating to the processing of those personal data, in particular, on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing. Natural persons will not be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights."

Moreover, in this case the controller will be collecting the personal data without knowing itself how and when these data will be used, since in its system the data is not identified as personal."

          "The inability to establish that the personal data exist in the system or that a third party can establish links between different pieces of information and, consequently, guess the existence of such data, will prevent us from ensuring that the data are accurate and kept up to date. As a result of this unawareness, controllers will not be able to ensure accuracy at all stages of collecting and processing of personal data and take every reasonable step to ensure that inaccurate data are erased or rectified without delay. Thus, contrary to the principle of accuracy, controllers will not make sure that outdated data are eliminated, or that data are correctly interpreted."

          "The compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality will be also jeopardized since the processing of the data, deemed as non-personal, will not be as secure as required for the personal data processing, “including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures” (Article 5(1)(f) GDPR). This will result in a lack of appropriate controls to prevent unauthorised access to the personal data as well as implement systemic quality controls in order to ensure that an appropriate level of security is reached. Moreover, the personal data will not be validated (e.g. using hashes), which might lead to some negative consequences, such as inability to guarantee its integrity and, consequently, the accuracy of that data."
